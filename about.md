# About Us

## Our Mission
Founded in 2024, APEX at ASU aims to advance turbopump technology for liquid rocket engines, bridging classroom learning with hands-on aerospace innovation.

## Our Goals
- Develop a kerosene/LOX turbopump for a liquid rocket engine.  
- Conduct static tests by Spring 2025.  
- Prepare members for careers in aerospace through real-world projects.

## Team Structure
Our team includes design, fabrication, and analysis subteams, collaborating to bring our turbopump to life. We meet weekly to iterate on designs, build components, and plan tests.

## History
Started as a small group of rocketry enthusiasts at ASU, APEX has grown into a dedicated club tackling real-world propulsion challenges, with a focus on turbopumps for liquid rocket engines.
