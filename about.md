# About Us

## Our Mission
Founded in 2024, APEX at ASU aims to advance turbopump technology for liquid rocket engines, bridging classroom learning with hands-on aerospace innovation.

## Our Goals
- Develop a kerosene/LOX turbopump for a liquid rocket engine.  
- Conduct static tests by Spring 2025.  
- Prepare members for careers in aerospace through real-world projects.  
[See Our Projects](/projects)

## Team Structure
Our team includes design, fabrication, and analysis subteams, collaborating to bring our turbopump to life. We meet weekly to iterate on designs, build components, and plan tests.

## History
APEX at ASU initially started as an idea between two students passionate about rocketry and propulsion. As interest grew, more students were onboarded, and we decided to pursue the idea with the original leadership as our starting crew. Since then, weâ€™ve continued to onboard new members and replenish our numbers, building a dedicated team focused on advancing turbopump technology for liquid rocket engines.
